    <h3>Why should <b>you</b> care about <b>Armand</b>? </h3>
    Because Armand is an exquisitely rich character, someone who has been alive long enough to dive into all the philosophical questions about being a vampire that Lestat didn’t care about but that Louis obsesses over. Lengthy stretches of Rice’s novel involve Armand and Louis arguing about the moral nature of vampirism and whether there are “gradations of evil,” as Armand puts it. His teachings inspire differing reactions in Louis and Claudia that may tear apart the family they have worked so hard to protect after getting rid of Lestat. It’s dramatic!
